findbugs-all-the-bugs
=====================
An attempt to create all the bugs [Findbugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/bugDescriptions.html) can find. Far from complete!

Clone it and run `cz.rozumim.findbugsallbugs.TestsRunner` as an JUnit test. It checks that classes in each test case really have the bugs (or not). 

It will be much more complicated without [test-driven-detectors4findbugs
](https://github.com/youdevise/test-driven-detectors4findbugs). Thanks.

You may need Gradle as well.
